50 - replace bearings.
51 - test with wattmeter and correct.
52 - locate with a test lamp or growler and repair
53 - reduce tension using the following formula: center span of belt deflection should be 1/64 inch per inch of centerline span between driver and driven units. chain deflection should be 2% of centerline span.
54 - reduce thrust from driver or machine. ensure motor's magnetic center is correctly located.
55 - relieve supply to point set by the manufacturer.
56 - clean, repair, or replace.
57 - add to point set by the manufacturer.
58 - replace with the proper grade.
59 - decrease the brush spring tension.
60 - reduce the load. use a larger contactor.
61 - clean any discolored or dirty connections, and retighten them to the recommended torque setting.
62 - adjust the overtravel as necessary. replace the contacts, and replace the contact springs as required to correct any defects.
63 - clean the contact surfaces, using a fine file or sandpaper. /note/ when performing this task in a dusty environment, use a dust-tight enclosure.
64 - change the operating procedure, and check with the factory for contacts more suitable for the length of use.
65 - reduce the load. provide better ventilation. relocate the starter. use a larger contactor.
66 - replace with line and cables that meet the proper nec standards recommendation.

69 - adjust contacts to touch simultaneously within 1/32' or to the manufacturer's specifications.
70 - reduce the jogging cycle. use a larger contactor.
71 - readjust the accelerating time or the operating sequence. use a larger contactor.
72 - insulate the starter from shock. provide a more rigid support for the starter.
73 - adjust the overtravel, replace the contacts, replace the contact springs, and set them to the correct contact force as necessary.
74 - clean and dress the contact faces in a dust-free environment. /caution/ do not use an emery cloth to clean and dress the contact faces. use glasspaper or a diamond file.
75 - replace with an air breaker contactor. /note/ an air breaker contactor may have 10 to 20 times longer contact life than an oil-immersed contactor of equal rating.
76 - the breaker may be operating properly and clearing an overload. have an electrician check to see if the current is in excess of the thermal trip rating.
77 - visually inspect the breaker for discoloration that would indicate loose connections. have electricians torque the connections to the correct setpoint.
78 - visually inspect the breaker for discoloration that would indicate loose connections. have the electricians check and correctly tighten the connections. /note/ machine vibrations can cause cables to loosen and can also cause cold flow when aluminum cables are used. cold flow refers to the contraction of the aluminum when the line is cooling down after the load is removed. this shrinkage can sometimes cause the connections to loosen.
79 - replace with the correct size wire. /note/ since the cable acts as a heat sink and carries heat away from the breaker, the proper wire size is important.
80 - if the temperature fluctuates and frequently exceeds 140 °f, install an ambient compensating breaker.
81 - remove the trip unit from the base, and inspect it for discoloration. reinstall the trip unit, and torque it to the base in accordance with the designed settings that come with each unit. /note/ a bright cherry red color indicates a temperature of approximately 1,450 °f for the trip unit. if the unit has experienced thermal damage, then it must be replaced.
82 - adjust the magnetic trip rating to the next higher setting or until the breaker does not trip when the motor is started.
83 - retest, using a six-cycle impulse test. /note/ a slow or gradual increase in current until the trip range is reached results in the breaker tripping at a lower value than that indicated on the trip unit. a six-cycle impulse test should be used. this is how the breakers are calibrated at the factory.
84 - close the open circuit. /note/ if an open circuit happens during transfer, the peak current during transfer could exceed 20 times the full-load amperes. /caution/ an extremely high magnetic trip setting can be supplied on the breaker, but the desired motor protection will be lost.
85 - remove the breakers from high humidity locations since high humidity can cause dielectric and other problems associated with moisture. install heaters in the enclosure if the breakers cannot be removed from the humidity.
86 - remove the breakers from corrosive environments if possible.
87 - remove the cover from the breaker, and determine what type of attachment is fitted. ensure that the attachment is functioning correctly. ensure that the proper voltage is applied to an undervoltage release so that the breaker will operate when shunt trips are used. /warning/ ensure that the shunt trip is not energized while the operator is trying to close the breaker.
88 - adjust and secure the core clamps. if other problems exist, have a qualified electrician correct them.
89 - inform electrical maintenance.
90 - have them correct the condition.
91 - repair or replace as necessary.
92 - clean the coils.
93 - clean the air ducts.
94 - replace the insulation. reset the breakers or fires.
